          <br><br>
          This Privacy Policy describes how we manage, process and store personal data submitted in the context of providing our services. “Personal data” refers to any information relating to an identifiable individual or his or her personal identity.
          <br><br>
          Prepolic's use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.

  If a recipient of your emails sent via our services requests us to modify or delete his/her personal data, we will honor that request after proper verification and will inform you of it.
  <br><br><br>
  <strong>DATA RETENTION PERIODS</strong>
  <br><br>
  Prepolic only stores your data for the time needed to provide to you our services, and in no event no longer than 3 months after closing your account (unless otherwise required by law). You are able to access your personal data for as long as you hold an active account with us and for a period that varies depending on the type of data concerned. Your event data (statistics, for example), will be deleted every 3 months during active use of your account. Other data may be deleted at any time during active use of your account in accordance with the provisions set forth above.
  <br><br><br>
  
  <strong>LOCATION OF DATA STORAGE AND TRANSFERS</strong>
  <br><br>
  The host servers on which Prepolic processes and stores its databases are located exclusively within the Google infrastructure.

  <br><br><br>
  <strong>SECURITY</strong>
  <br><br>
  Within the framework of its services, Prepolic attributes the very highest importance to the security and integrity of its customers’ personal data.
  <br><br>
  Thus and in accordance with the GDPR, Prepolic undertakes to take all pertinent precautions in order to preserve the security of the data and, in particular, to protect them against any accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, corruption, unauthorised circulation or access, as well as against any other form of unlawful processing or disclosure to unauthorised persons.
  <br><br>
  To this end, Prepolic implements industry standard security measures to protect personal data from unauthorised disclosure. In using industry recommended methods of encoding, Prepolic takes the measures necessary to protect information connected with payments and credit cards.
  <br><br>
  Moreover, in order to avoid in particular all unauthorised access, to guarantee accuracy and the proper use of the data, Prepolic has put the appropriate electronic, physical and managerial procedures in place with a view to safeguarding and preserving the data gathered through its services.
  <br><br>
  Nothwithstanding this, there is no absolute safety from piracy or hackers. That is why in the event a breach of security were to affect you, Prepolic undertakes to inform you thereof without undue delay and to use its best efforts to take all possible measures to neutralise the intrusion and minimise the impacts. Should you suffer any loss by reason of the exploitation by a third party of a security breach, Prepolic undertakes to provide you with every assistance necessary so you are able to assert your rights. Moreover if, by some exceptional case, the direct loss incurred arose due to fault or gross negligence by Prepolic, you will be able to seek compensation within the limit of liability referred to in our Terms of Use.
  <br><br>
  You should keep in mind that any user, customer or hacker who discovers and takes advantage of a breach in security renders him or herself liable to criminal prosecution and that Prepolic will take all measures, including filing a complaint and/or bringing court action, to preserve the data and the rights of its users and of itself and to limit the impacts.
  <br><br><br>
